# Explanation of `casual_model.py`

This document provides a step-by-step explanation of the Python code in `casual_model.py`. The goal of the code is to perform a **causal inference analysis** on how different measures of technological innovation (R&D, patent filings, and high-tech exports) affect GDP growth in four major countries (USA, China, Japan, and Russia) during Tech 1.0 (1995–2002) and Tech 2.0 (2003–2012). The code also visualizes how well the model’s predictions match the actual GDP growth.

## Imports

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

- **pandas** (`pd`) is used for reading and manipulating data.
- **statsmodels.formula.api** (`smf`) provides an easy interface for specifying and fitting statistical models using formulas (like `GDP_Growth ~ RD + ...`).
- **matplotlib.pyplot** (`plt`) is used for creating the plots (Actual vs. Predicted, Residual Plot).

---

## Data Loading

```python
df = pd.read_csv("final_data.csv")
```

- Reads the CSV file `final_data.csv` into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.

---

## Data Filtering

```python
df = df[(df['Year'] >= 1995) & (df['Year'] <= 2012) &
        (df['Country'].isin(['USA','China','Japan','Russia']))].copy()
```

- **Year Range:** Keeps only rows for years 1995 through 2012 (inclusive).
- **Countries:** Keeps only the rows corresponding to the four specified countries.
- **`.copy()`** is used to avoid potential warnings about chained assignments.

---

## Column Renaming

```python
df.rename(columns={
    'R&D_Expenditure_Percentage': 'RD',
    'Patent_Apps_Residents': 'Patents',
    'HighTech_Exports_Percentage': 'HighTechExports'
}, inplace=True)
```

- Renames the columns from their original names to simpler aliases:
  - `R&D_Expenditure_Percentage` → `RD`
  - `Patent_Apps_Residents` → `Patents`
  - `HighTech_Exports_Percentage` → `HighTechExports`
- This makes it easier to refer to these columns in the formula for the regression model.

---

## Feature Engineering

```python
df['Patents_thousands'] = df['Patents'] / 1000.0
```

- Creates a new column called `Patents_thousands` by dividing the `Patents` column by 1,000.
- This scaling makes the regression coefficient easier to interpret (change in GDP growth per thousand patents, rather than per single patent).

---

## Model Specification and Fitting

```python
model = smf.ols('GDP_Growth ~ RD + Patents_thousands + HighTechExports + C(Country) + C(Year)', 
                data=df).fit()
```

- **Formula:** `'GDP_Growth ~ RD + Patents_thousands + HighTechExports + C(Country) + C(Year)'`
  - **Dependent Variable:** `GDP_Growth`
  - **Independent Variables:** 
    - `RD` (R&D as % of GDP)
    - `Patents_thousands` (scaled patent filings)
    - `HighTechExports` (high-tech exports as % of total manufacturing exports)
  - **Fixed Effects:** 
    - `C(Country)` includes country-level dummies to control for time-invariant country differences.
    - `C(Year)` includes year-level dummies to control for global shocks or trends affecting all countries in a given year.
- **`fit()`** runs the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and stores the fitted model in `model`.

---

## Model Summary

```python
print(model.summary())
```

- Prints a comprehensive summary of the fitted regression model, including:
  - Coefficients for each variable
  - Standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals
  - Model fit statistics (R-squared, F-statistic, etc.)

---

## Generating Predictions

```python
df['predicted_GDP_Growth'] = model.predict(df)
```

- Uses the fitted model to predict `GDP_Growth` for each row in the dataset.
- Stores the predicted values in a new column, `predicted_GDP_Growth`.

---

## Visualization: Actual vs. Predicted

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(df['GDP_Growth'], df['predicted_GDP_Growth'], color='blue', alpha=0.7)
plt.plot([df['GDP_Growth'].min(), df['GDP_Growth'].max()], 
         [df['GDP_Growth'].min(), df['GDP_Growth'].max()], 'r--', label='Perfect Prediction')
plt.xlabel("Actual GDP Growth (%)")
plt.ylabel("Predicted GDP Growth (%)")
plt.title("Actual vs. Predicted GDP Growth")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

- **Scatter Plot:** 
  - X-axis: Actual `GDP_Growth`
  - Y-axis: Predicted `GDP_Growth`
- **Red Dashed Line:** Represents the line of perfect prediction (where actual = predicted).
- **Interpretation:** Points near the red line indicate better predictions; large deviations indicate under- or over-prediction.

---

## Visualization: Residual Plot

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(df['predicted_GDP_Growth'], df['GDP_Growth'] - df['predicted_GDP_Growth'], 
            color='green', alpha=0.7)
plt.axhline(0, color='red', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel("Predicted GDP Growth (%)")
plt.ylabel("Residuals (Actual - Predicted)")
plt.title("Residual Plot")
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

- **Residuals:** Actual minus predicted (`GDP_Growth - predicted_GDP_Growth`).
- **Red Horizontal Line:** Represents zero residual (perfect prediction).
- **Interpretation:** Residuals should ideally be randomly scattered around zero with no clear pattern, indicating that the model assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, etc.) are reasonably met.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Causal Model:** By including country and year fixed effects, the model accounts for unobserved heterogeneity across countries and global year-specific events, aiming to isolate the **direct impact** of R&D, patent activity, and high-tech exports on GDP growth.
2. **Predictions:** Even though the main goal is causal inference, the model also generates within-sample predictions for GDP growth, which can be visualized to assess the model’s fit.
3. **Diagnostics:** The residual plot and actual-vs-predicted plot help verify that the model is performing adequately. Outliers or strong patterns in the residuals may indicate a need for further refinement or additional control variables.
